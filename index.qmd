## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Statistics and Data Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Being a first-generation Latina dedicated to pursuing a STEM degree, I am actively searching for a company committed to prioritizing diversity in the tech sector and fostering equity in career advancement. My research at UCLA focused on individual retention rates for Latinas in STEM, igniting a deep passion for addressing the existing disparities within higher education and the tech industries. I am enthusiastically looking to align myself with a company that shares these values and is dedicated to rectifying the current imbalances for Latinas in these crucial fields. Attached is my current [resume.](/Resume/Rubio_Angelique_Resume.pdf "Resume")
